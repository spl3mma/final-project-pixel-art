  My project is about a small frog who can hop along your screen using the arrow keys. The Pygame library was used for this project, as I considered it to be similar to the foundation of a game; creating a sprite sheet! Pixilart was used to create the different sprites, and the background was an open source image found on Reddit. My initial scope of the project was not quite complex enough, so I added the ability to move the frog, (I named him Blit!) 

  I think I unfortunately made him a little small, and had already written most of my code before I realized I only made him 100x100 pixels, so in the future I would like to size him up. I also would have liked to make and animate the background as well and make it a little more interactive, but with the time constraints and my current skill level, it was just not feasible with this project, unfortunately.
